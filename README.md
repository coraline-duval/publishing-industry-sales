## How can the publishing industry leverage analytics on new releases to forecast and increase sales?

This is my MSc Business Analytics final report of 2021.

### Abstract

While books and writings were one of the main entertainment sources up to the start of the 21st century, they are today not able to compete with social media and streaming platforms in todayâ€™s attention economy. One of the reasons is that publishing industries are not leveraging consumers data at nearly the same level as their other media competitors.
This report explores two stages of the release of a book to understand and predict a book sales performance through its popularity. First, during the pre-release period, the publisher has control over some of the book features and can, using data, optimize them to maximize the popularity of the book. Then, during the post-release period, a publisher can use user-generated data around the book such as ratings or reviews to predict the overall performance of the book.
Through linear regressions, it was found for the pre-release features that neutral colors for the covers, a shorter title conveying a positive sentiment, the publication in March or October, and a form of eBook format led to higher sales. For post-release, using reviews in the 3 months following publication, an average positive sentiment conveyed by the text reviews is linked to higher sales volumes.
These results show how data can be used by publishers to make their products, books, more appealing to customers, and how it can help them grow their sales. One main limitation of this report was finding sources of data, especially data regarding book sales. While publishers might feel like protecting their data advantages them against other publishers, they should consider grouping forces to help the industry as a whole reduce the gap they have with other entertainment media on the uses of data and artificial intelligence in their businesses.
